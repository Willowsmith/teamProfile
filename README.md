# teamProfile


## Creating a clean and responsive website for a professional portfolio.

-My motivation was to create code that allows a user to launch a website showing their team using the console to input the data.
-I built this project so that I could learn how to create team profile website utilizing express and node as well as writing code to pass tests.
-The problem that I solved were the display of data, making sure the tests passed, and that the information was correctly displayed.
-I learned about TDD, express, and node.
